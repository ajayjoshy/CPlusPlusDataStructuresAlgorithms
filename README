NB: git tip: Adding a new project to github 
Step 1) Create and intitialize your local git
Step 2) Create an empty repository in gihub, note down its github clone URL: https://github.com/ajayjoshy/CPlusPlusDataStructuresAlgorithms.git
Step 3) Add a remote repo named  "origin" to the local repo created in Step 1)
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/ajayjoshy/CPlusPlusDataStructuresAlgorithms.git
Step 4) Push your branch("master") to Github
$ git push origin master


NB: Incase its the first time you are pushing to github, its possible for the remote repo to contain files that are not included in the local repo,
hence its important to pull (fetch/merge) the corresponding branch from the remote repo once before Step 4)
$ git pull origin master
